## First Orientation

Through this article, I want to demonstrate different culture that I faced when working in Japanese company. So currently, Rakuten Mobile Inc. is getting hot attentions from Rakuten and hiring people from all over the world. My colleagues, all had work experiences and were settled as somewhat managing positions. Before the orientation, I was given a laptop and had to set the VPN and intranet following the instructions given. (You can choose OS from windows or mac) It was pain for me to go to cafeteria to get the wifi because I was using Mac.

## Orientation

Orientation proceeded about four hours and in between two hours, we went to get a lunch. During the time, we could meet each other but I wish there were a time that we could gather together and introduce each other. The orientation for international employees taught mainly about adjustments in Japan. (going to ward office, getting a new housing, creating bacnk accounts and etc.)
