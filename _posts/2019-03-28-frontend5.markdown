## PHP

Before going onto more about PHP, let's review some what PHP is. PHP is a server-side language which means when receiving request, the webserver uses PHP engine or interpreter to translate any php part of the request, ex) <? php ?> to an output and to return the results.

Now, let's review some of the simple grammars of PHP.

```javascript
<?php
    echo $_GET['name'].",".$_GET['id'];
?>
```

Above php code will return one line output of name, id

Now, where are those variables?

We can simply pass them when we call the php file! -> "localhost/php/1.php?name=jimmy&id=1"

Here, I am passing Jimmy and 1 as my name and id. The php file then automatically takes those values and echo them. The question mark is there to distinguish file and variables. The & is there to distinguish different variables. We can then, apply this logic to a more complicated syntax.

```javascript
<html>
<head>
<title></title>
</head>
<body>
<?php
    echo file_get_contents("1.txt");
?>
</body>
</html>
```

Above code, as you expected, will print out 1.txt. Therefore, we can easily assume that text files or even, other files can be called through php.
