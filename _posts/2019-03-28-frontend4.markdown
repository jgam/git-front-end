## A little dtail on Javascript

Let us start with a simple HTML code and see one of the most important concepts of javascript that it is  **Event Driven** language.

```javascript
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
</head>
<body>
  <input type="button" value="white" onclick="alert('Hello World')"/>
  <input type="text" onfocus="alert('focus')" onblur="alert('blur')"/>
</body>
</html>

```

The following command will be shown on the broswer as this:

<div class="side-by-side">
    <div class="tocenter">
        <img class="image" src="{{ site.url }}/{{ site.frontend1}}" alt="Alt Text">
        <figcaption class="caption">Photo by jgam CREDIT: jgam</figcaption>
    </div>
</div>

What happends when you click the white button? Yes, as you can see it in the code of onclick action, you will see alert API of Hello World. Similar to onclick, there exist several actions which are onfocus and onblur. These actions also advocate how Javascript is a event-driven language.
