## Object Oriented Design
Object-Oriented design question requires a candidate to sketch out the classes and methods to implement technical problems or real-life objects.

#How to Approach?
1. Handle Ambiguity
Object oriented design questions are often intentionally vague in order to test . When being asked an ood question, you should inquire who is going to use it and how they are going to use it.
2. Define the core objevts
After understanding what we are designing, we should consider what the core objects in a system are.
3. Analyze Relationships
Having more or less decided on our core objects, we now want to analyze the relationships between the objects. Which objects are members of which other objects?
4. Investigate Actions
At this point, you should have the basic outline of your object-oriented design. What remains is to consider the key actions that the objects will take and how they relate to each other.


#Design Patterns
1. Singleton Class
2. Factory Method
