## Actual programming! (JAVASCRIPT or PHP)

What happens when we call a php file to webserver such as **https://~~~.com/a.php**?

Since this is not a markup language, the webeserver will call an *interpreter* that can translate the php file. (so called "php engine") Now, the php engine will translate the .php file. When translating, the engine skips familiar HTML tags until it sees **<?php?>**. Then, the information we fetched from such php file is now passed on to the HTML file which we can be displayed on the web browser.

## Learn Javascript and PHP together!

SO far HTML & CSS are static languages where we just display info to the users while Javascript and PHP are rather dynamic languages because they can bascically create different myriads number of ways to create those static representations. The two languages are similar in a way that they are dynamic but they differ in that Javascript is web-browser language and PHP is a web server language. This might be a little harder concept to understand and looking at the picture below will make your understanding WAYYYY easier.
