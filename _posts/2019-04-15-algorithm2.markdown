## Directions Reductions

So I was hoping to use Map reduce through this problem. However, I found another fancy way which is to use pointer of this problem. The problem asks for

```javascript
function dirReduc(arr){
  var i = 0;    
  while(i < arr.length) {
    if((arr[i] === "NORTH" && arr[i+1] === "SOUTH") ||
    (arr[i] === "SOUTH" && arr[i+1] === "NORTH") ||
    (arr[i] === "EAST" && arr[i+1] === "WEST") ||
    (arr[i] === "WEST" && arr[i+1] === "EAST")) {
        console.log(i)
        console.log(arr)
        arr.splice(i, 2);
        i--;
        console.log(arr)
    }
    else {
        i++;
    }
  }
  return arr;
}
```
