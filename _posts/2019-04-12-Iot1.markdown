## The Internet of Things

What is IoT? I have been wrondering what the term actually means. It is by Wikipedia, defined as the internet of things. So, does that mean it is some soft of internet, like web? or the ease of accessing information? After reading quite a few articles(may be 1 or 2), I found out that it is a somewhat broad concept of becoming smarter and smarter. One example, I thought about is a remote controller from the movie called ["Click"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Click_(2006_film))

Long story short, the remote controller controls the protagonist, Adam Sandler's life. He can *literally* fast-forward and rewind his life to the time periods where he wants to be.

Now let's go back to the IoT. Surprisingly, the remote controller that I mentioned is happening in our life by little and little. When I first got an ipod Touch, I was so shocked to go online through safari and check the ESPN soccer highlights. (of course the UI at that time was not as great as that of today but STILL) Similarly, through your phone, you can even register a Language test(Yes, I did register JLPT on my iphone.)

Yes, IoT is an interconnected network thta allows devices such as phones, computers, any other house hold goods to not only communicate with humans but also with each other.

One example I can think of is, when we run a laundary, the dryer automatically hits up five minutes before the laundary gets done or even the closet lines up empty hangers so that we can use them to dry our laundaries. COOL, isn't it?
