## Rakuten

Because I am a footballer it is just surreal to not be aware of FC Barcelona which is probably one of the most well know soccer teams from Spain. The very famous player "the God" Lionel Messi is a captain of the team. Since a few years ago, after having Qatar Airways on their chests as their sponsor company, FC Barcelona made a contract with Rakuten and that was my first impression of the company Rakuten because I was aware of the name of the company, rather did not know what the company was actually about.

Coming into Japan, I realized how huge Rakuten is with its e-commerce business and building platforms for various industries. Recently, they announced that they want to be huge in mobile industry and shoot for fourth largest mobile company in Japan. In conclusion, it is a BIG company and engineering program there is undoubtful.

## Opportunity

My sister who is also trying to get a new job (luckily she is at a final verge of getting an offer from SONY) referred me with Rakuten opportunity and although the company only listed opportunities for project managers, seionrs, and non-engineering positions, I still gave it a try thinking that tech background will be a difference that I can provide among other candidates.
