## Why Blog?

I have a dream and I feel like this blog can be my **drawings of my dream** in many ways.

More importantly, I hope this blog can deliver messages to people just like I did receive one from those of others.



## What to include?

Mostly Algorithms. I want to publish not only the concepts but also problems.

While exploring algorithmic approaches, I want to dig deeper into the interactions between language and operating system

## What to expect?

Hopefully, I can engage other people (in a humble way) and create or think something greater.

## Finishing...

Thank you so much for reading and approach me through any means as you will find my contacts in homepage.
