##First Interview

Now it was the day for the first interview and took me almost hour and a half to get to crimson house from my home. When I first got to the Futako-Tamagwa station, I was really surprised that the site was modern and luxurious. I see department stores with almost 10 floors with full of various brands. Also, the organic stores on the first floor seemed to be targeting rich people. Anyways, it took me about 5 minutes to get to crimson house 20 minutes before the interview started. The instruction said that I had to get a ticket from the ticket booth and simpy "wait" there. I got the ticket sticker and put it on my left chest like everyone who had their stickes there and sat down at a lobby table for 10 minutes. Around 5 minutes before, I got up and a woman with an ipad reached to me asking if my name was jgam and I said yes. She took me to 7th floor where lots of private meeting rooms were located and went one of the rooms to wait for my department's head.

##The First Interview Process

The department's head soon arrived at the room and we started talking. The interview lasted about 30 minutes and the time scheduling in Japan was the finiest! Right after the interview, the interviewer escorted me back to the lobby on the first floor and I was waiting for a current Rakuten software developer to talk about the life at Rakuten and goals as a developer. He took me to Indian place and was awesome although somewhat crowded. After that, we got our coffee and chatted while walking around Crimson House which had exclusive views and scenes. Anyways, two hours later I was notified that I was fowarded to the next round of interview. Just like the first one, I sent Rakuten several time slots.

## Second Interview

I really wanted to get done with the interviews as early as possible especially before the long week of break which was called a golden break. Unfortunately, things didn't work out well and I had to do an interview after the golden week which took another two weeks for me. After the golden week, I visited Rakuten Crimson House again.
