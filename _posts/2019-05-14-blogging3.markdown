##First Interview

Now it was the day for the first interview and took me almost hour and a half to get to crimson house from my home. When I first got to the Futako-Tamagwa station, I was really surprised that the site was modern and luxurious. I see department stores with almost 10 floors with full of various brands. Also, the organic stores on the first floor seemed to be targeting rich people. Anyways, it took me about 5 minutes to get to crimson house 20 minutes before the interview started. The instruction said that I had to get a ticket from the ticket booth and simpy "wait" there. I got the ticket sticker and put it on my left chest like everyone who had their stickes there and sat down at a lobby table for 10 minutes. Around 5 minutes before, I got up and a woman with an ipad reached to me asking if my name was jgam and I said yes. She took me to 7th floor where lots of private meeting rooms were located and went one of the rooms to wait for my department's head.
