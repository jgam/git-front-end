## longest palindrome in a substring

We often face problems like palindromes. What is palindrome? it is a combination of two strings that are reversely ordered to each other and the middle character of the combined string can be diregarded. This wording is little rough until you see the actual example.

abba -> palindrome
abbb -> not a palindrome
abcba -> palindrome

So, now our task is to search through longest palindromes and return the length of the longest palindrome.
