## WHat is Reactive Native?

## Several important files

1. index.js -> kicks off the files and runs the function App component in App.js
2. App.js -> we render and import original react. React native doesn't work with the normal DOM or normal CSS or normal Javascript and all of these special things are given to you as with React Native.
3. the style variable is a style sheet object of react native and can be assigned to component. It emulates CSS.
